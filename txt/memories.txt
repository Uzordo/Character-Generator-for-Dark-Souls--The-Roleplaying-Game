A man stands over you with a bloody knife, laughing. Laughing and laughing.
The scent of earth in your nose, as it fell onto your face. Were you buried alive?
The grasping, clawing hands of hollows everywhere.
The roar of something... something vast... behind you.
A roaring explosion, sudden blazing heat, spray of stone, and then darkness.
Watching as the rock beneath your hands suddenly gave way.
Joyful smiles on the faces of people you love, becoming rictuses of agony.
How hard breathing had become. How you werent sure where your neck ended, and your body began.
A flame blossoming into life somewhere ahead of you, flickering in the dark.
The screams and chaos of a bandit raid, running, arrows flickering past you...
Horses hooves, trampling down on you, imperiously.
The beating of wings, and the sudden darkening of the sky.
Applause. A crowd, gathered to watch you die, and were pleased as you did.
Touching that treasure chest.
The roughness of a rope around your neck, the stifling interior of a hemp sack over your head, the feeling of nothing beneath your feet for a moment.
Someone shouting in your face, and a punch. No worse than you’d received before but this time...
A thud. A second thud. No pain. Not initially. And then you glanced down to see arrows, protruding from your chest.
You knew you shouldn’t have read those words aloud.
A pain in your chest. Searing, your left arm aching and useless.
